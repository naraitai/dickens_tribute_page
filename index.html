                    <h3 class="sub head">Childhood</h3>
                    <p>
                        Charles John Huffman Dickens was born in Portsmouth on 7th February 1812 to John and Elizabeth.
                        After leaving Portsmouth the Dickens family settled in Chatham where they spent a happy time.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, the happiness did not last. In 1824 Charles Dickens were taken out of school
                        and went to work at Warren's boot-blacking factory. This change of fortunes was as a result of his father,
                        John Dickens, being imprisoned for debt. In fact, all of the Dickens went to Marshalsea leaving Charles behind.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        After receiving an inheritance John Dickens was able to pay the Â£40 debt he owed and was released. As a result 
                        Charles Dickens was able to return to school. However, his interrupted education came to an end at 15.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="sub head">Early Adulthood</h3>
                    <p>
                        After his schooling Dickens went to work as a clerk in a solicitor's office. This led to a job as a court
                        reporter and finally to a parliamentary journalist. This gave Dickens an understanding of the legal world
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="sub head">Adulthood</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the 1830s Dickens works as a parliamentary journalist while also publishing sketches under the name 'Boz'.
                        It is also in this decade that Dickens meets and marries Catherine Hogarth, with whom he will have ten children.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="sub head">Social Commentry</h3>
                    <p>
                        Charles Dickens published many works, but there is a unifying role; social commentary.
                        It is his criticism of the social and economic abuses of the Victorin era that Dickens is best known.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        The influence of Dickens' own childhood suffering on his work is clear in stories like Oliver Twist 
                        and David Copperfield. This compassion and understanding for his fellow man is why is he still one of
                        the most read of great Victorian era writers.
